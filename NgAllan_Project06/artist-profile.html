                    <p>The single “Dumbass”, premiered last month along with its music video, is included in the album. “The Divine Comedy” features six tracks with vocals and lyrics by Ai Weiwei, and music by Zuoxiao Zuzhou. Each song is a different take of Ai’s newfound channel for expression through music. The album includes commentaries on current events (Just Climb the Wall, Hotel USA), documentations of real dialogues (Chaoyang Park, Laoma Tihua), and personal reflections (Give Tomorrow Back to Me, Dumbass). The full album crosses musical genres with influences from pop, rock, punk and heavy metal, and takes us on a journey through Ai’s experience with the conditions of China.</p>

                    <p><a href="https://fakecase.com/">FakeCase.com</a> is the definitive source for information on the Chinese authorities’ “tax case” against Ai Weiwei, the Chinese artist who was secretly detained for 81 days from April 3 to June 22, 2011. The charges of tax evasion, online dissemination of pornography, and bigamy that were levied against Ai are widely perceived as political retaliation for his outspoken criticism of the government.</p>
