            <p>I was told to change some the icons of the contacts at the bottom of each page to better represent what it is.</p>
            <p>Take away the words that specify the contacts at the bottom because they should be intuitive to know what those icons mean.</p>
            <p>More spacing between words and pictures.</p>
